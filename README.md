Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

This example makes use of ml5.js and p5.js (and tf.js)

p5.js (processing) is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive.
ml5.js (machine learning) is a JavaScript library that provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building on top of TensorFlow.js with no other external dependencies.
tf.js (tensorflow) is a JavaScript library for training and deploying models in the browser and on Node.js.
